# Clients-Data

### SCREENSHOT:

## Overview and Description:

    This application was designed to help streamline server data onto a more user-friendly dashboard. It works in tandem with ProjectOne, an application designed to streamline server data onto a user-friendly dashboard that checks the expirations on the Client's domain names (https://reburke286.github.io/ProjectOne/).

## Features and Usage:

    When used in conjunction with ProjectOne, it is client-specific and was created to help the Client's IT Team manage their business clients for the purpose of assisting with parsing 1000+ daily emails received.

    The application streamlines data into a Dashboard which performs a daily check to dynamically append data by using a conditional statement that determines where data is stored.
